# wercstyle

A werc lookalike, for Algernon.

* This is also a quick demonstration of `.alg` archives.
* The Lua code is a bit hacky, but the concept that you can edit the contents of the web pages by only editing Markdown files, remains.

## Requirements

* [Algernon](https://github.com/xyproto/algernon)
* For now, the `sitemap` page requires `find` and `sort` to be available.

## Quick start

* `make` to build `werc.alg`
* `make run` to serve `werc.alg` at port 9000
* `make debug` to serve the current directory at port 9000

## General info

* Version: 1.0.0
